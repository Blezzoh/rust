1. helloworld: "!" on printfn means it is a macro otherwise if it was a function it would have been be "printfn"
2. hello-cargo: "cargo new" creates a new cargo project, "cargo build" build project, "cargo run" builds and also runs the project, and "cargo check" build the project without generating binaries for error checking
